# Gutter Synthesis
A Max-based synthesis program exploring a set of eight coupled [Duffing Oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffing_equation).

Standalone versions of the synth can be found via these links:
- [OS X][http://tommudd.co.uk/gutter/software/guttersynth_64bit_osx.zip]
- [Windows][http://tommudd.co.uk/gutter/software/guttersynth_64bit_windows.zip]

Gutter synthesis is a purely digital synthesis process that creates very physical, acoustic-like sounds using a network of resonant Duffing oscillators. The software was created specifically for this project, and is included with the release as an equal part of the creative output. This version uses an interrelated set of eight Duffing oscillators and associated filter banks.

The synth was used for the [Entrâ€™acte release](https://entracte.co.uk/projects/tom-mudd-e226/) of the same name
